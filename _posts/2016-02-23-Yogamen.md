Card Climbers was the very first project I developed, with the help of other 5 students, during winter 2014/2015. This game is a two player 2D competitive platformer where the objective is to reach the top of every level before your opponent.

This game is set in a futuristic world, where in a desert city some gangs are fighting for a valuable Aztec treasure. The game involves non-lethal combat mechanics: the players can shoot each other in order to knock the other player off the level. Card Climbers requires precise moves and jumps: missing a platform would probably mean death!
