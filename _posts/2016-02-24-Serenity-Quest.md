#Serenity Quest  
Serenity Quest is a mobile puzzle game that I developed with other 4 people over the course of 5 weeks.  
In Serenity Quest the player manages a Temple and he has to produce food in order to maintain his monks. The goal is to spread influence to the surrounding villages and convert the whole region, monks have to travel to nearby towns and they will spend more food by doing so.
The game was developed in Unity3D (C#) where I mostly did gameplay programming along integration of the assets that were regularly produced.
The project was developed in 5 iterations: every week we would test a prototype and improve upon it in the next, giving everybody in the team the chance to be heavily involved with every design detail.
The project was developed for [Smart Art Studio](http://www.smartart-gamestudio.com/).
