#Arbor - Serious game for Ergo-Enzo
Arbor is the biggest project I worked on, in my first year as main school assignment. Arbor is an applied game targeted to nurses and healthcare workers that aims at raising awareness about Dutch ARBO regulations.

Arbor is a management game where the player controls treant units that can perform various tasks, in order to keep their tree healthy. Everytime a task is completed, an event is fired based on the different statistics. Events will test the player knowledge and thinking processes by changing the production rate of the units, killing or empowering them, giving them better tools and generally affecting the flow of the game, making sure the player always has to think about an efficient way of responding to an event.
