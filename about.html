	Hi, my name is Giacomo "Jack" Camporini, I'm currently studying Game Design at the HanzeHogeschool of Groningen, I enjoy developing videogames, I love to see games evolving from their design process into the development phase and then final product. I am currently focusing on learning design patterns and architecture design, in order to get my projects' workflow to a satisfying speed/quality ratio.
	I am currently working on university projects, while in my free time I try to experiment new techniques on small projects.
